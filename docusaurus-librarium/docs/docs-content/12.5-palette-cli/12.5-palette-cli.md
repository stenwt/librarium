# Overview

The Palette CLI contains various functionalities that you can use to interact with Palette and manage resources. The Palette CLI is well suited for Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and recommended for automation tasks, where Terraform or direct API queries are not ideal.
